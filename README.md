Module 2: Elementary Programming
Assignment 2: Calculating Future Investment Value

Problem Description: Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula, and displays the future investment value using the following formula:

futureInvestmentValue =   investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12

For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.

Hint: Use the Math.pow(a, b) method to compute a raised to the power of b.

Submit the following item as Assign2.java. Compile, run, and verify that you are getting a similar run to what I listed below (you must submit the program regardless whether it complete or incomplete, correct or incorrect).

Here is a sample run:

Sample 1:

Enter investment amount: 1000

Enter annual interest rate: 4.25

Enter number of years: 1

Accumulated value is 1043.34

Sample 2:

Enter investment amount: 1000

Enter annual interest rate: 4.25

Enter number of years: 1

Accumulated value is 1043.34
